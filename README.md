# Programming Equidecomposability

When can one polygon can be formed from another by cutting it into a finite number of pieces and recomposing these by translations and rotations? The Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem says that this is possible if and only the two polygons have the same area.

Given two random triangles, our algorithm cuts one into the other, and animates this transformation.

## Animation Files

Here are the animation files demonstrating the transformation:

- [Example Animation 1](animations/equidecomposability_animation_1.mp4)
- [Example Animation 2](animations/equidecomposability_animation_2.mp4)
- [Example Animation 3](animations/equidecomposability_animation_3.mp4)
